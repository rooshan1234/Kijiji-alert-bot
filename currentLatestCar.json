[{"title":"1996 Honda Civic DX Hatchback","desc":"I have a well used and taken care of Honda Civic for sale. Sadly the windshield needs replacing and a new exhaust pipe (i cut off the old one cause of raddling) so i have to sell it as a parts car for it wont pass inspection as is. \rThe body has high kilometers but the engine was replaced a few years ago and it has 200000 km on it. \rIt does not leak oil and burns very little. \rHence i am asking 1000 or best offer. \rMUST SELL BEFORE OCT 30.\rI'll also give a set (4 tires) of winter tires into the deal.","price":"$1,000.00"}]
